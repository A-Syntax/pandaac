pandaac is currently in active development, and has yet to reach a stable version. As a temporary measure, pandaac is shipped with a naked theme and does consist of bugs.

Immediately upon visiting a freshly installed copy, you will be presented by countless errors about missing view files. This 

```sh
composer create-project pandaac/pandaac --stability=dev
```

*pandaac is based upon the amazing Laravel framework, and as of right now, please refer to their documentation.*
